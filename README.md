# Christmas 2024 Challenge 🧑‍🎄

A challenge set by [Bruno Simon](https://github.com/brunosimon) in his private [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com) Discord server.

It's a simple snowy scene that utilizes essential fundamental knowledge of Three.js, such as: importing custom models, structuring and organizing the codebase, creating custom buffer geometries and particles, configuring textures and more.
